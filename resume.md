Well-rounded software engineering leader. I build collaborative, effective engineering teams and help develop leaders, all in service of making great products people love.

I foster a supportive environment, where being open and vulnerable leads to deeper connections, growth from taking risks, and a stronger team overall.

Worked cross-team to create roadmaps balancing product and engineering needs. Delivered changes with the biggest impact while minimizing development cost.

Mentored managers across the company, including outside of engineering, and consistently received feedback that it made a positive impact in their leadership.

Designed and built a custom version of a flagship product, including migrating thousands of accounts to a new platform. I drove the project end-to-end, working directly with stakeholders at one of PayScale's largest customers.

I served my team by encouraging leadership, collaboration, and personal initiative. Nurturing their development through regular 1:1s, career planning, and new experiences.
