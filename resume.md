xsubtitle: Hi, my name is Alex
---
Well-rounded software engineering leader. I build collaborative, effective engineering teams and help develop leaders, all in service of making great products.

I foster a supportive environment where it is my belief and experience that being open and vulnerable leads to deeper connections, growth from taking risk, and a stronger team overall.

### PayScale, Seattle, WA — Software Development Manager ###
##### *Jan 2018 - Feb 2020* #####

Led software development of PayScale's SaaS business applications in Seattle. Led two distributed full-stack teams across 3 products and directly managed 7 engineers.

Focus was on leading development of a cloud-based pay cycle administration product. It was halfway through a complete rewrite when I was asked to take it over. Completed core functionality and addressed key performance, security, scalability, and stability issues while increasing test coverage and reducing the support cost.

Worked cross team to create roadmaps balancing product and engineering needs. Delivered changes with the biggest impact while minimizing development cost.

Mentored managers across the company, including outside of engineering, and consistently receive feedback that it makes a positive impact in their leadership.

Designed and built a custom version of a flagship product, including migrating thousands of accounts to the new platform. I drove the project end-to-end, working directly with stakeholders of one of PayScale's largest customers.

I serve my team through encouraging leadership at all levels, collaboration and taking initiative, nurturing their development through regular 1:1s, career planning, and helping them find ways to gain new experiences and build reputation.

As a full-stack developer on PayScale's SaaS business products, I built major new features and overhauled existing services, introducing modern front-end technologies that were adopted by the team.

Identified a new source of revenue and created a brand new type of job. Used my side project (web chat) to convince multiple levels of management across Product Development, Marketing, and Sales teams to create and fill the new opening. (I personally piloted chat directly with potential customers, contributing to over $180,000 in new opportunities over a two-week period).
