title: About me
subtitle: Hi, my name is Alex
---
I'm a software engineering leader. I build collaborative teams and help develop leaders, all in service of delivering great products.

I foster a supportive environment where it is my belief and experience that being able to be open and vulnerable leads to deeper connections, growth from taking risk, and a stronger team overall. 

I serve my team through encouraging leadership at all levels, encourage both collaboration and taking initiative, nurturing their development through regular 1:1s, career planning, and helping them find ways to gain new experiences and build reputation.

I also mentor managers across the company, including outside of engineering, and consistently receive feedback that it makes a positive impact in their leadership.
