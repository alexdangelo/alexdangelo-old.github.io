"Wow, this is the coolest company". 

Not our words but from a candidate here to interview for a job. The person at the front desk was asked about what we were doing and said we were engineers hacking out a feature together. She even encouraged us to come back and hack on floor one again in the future.

We all love the feeling of working together during hack day. Why shouldn't every day be like that? 

So that's exactly what we did. The team spent the day designing and building a system that solves a specific problem.

The result? Significant learning for everyone, discovery, uncovered details, an architecture, a plan, and working code. The task had the right bits and pieces working to address the goal in the current sprint, with a clear path towards how it can be completed in a future sprint. And a desire to continue to have team hack days.
