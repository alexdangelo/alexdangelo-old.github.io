Every month Hacker News has a "Who Is Hiring" thread. I posted a single job for a full-stack software engineer on Nov 2, 2020.

**Summary**: Most applicants are fresh out of university or a coding school and have 0-2 years experience, are male, and located in the US.

**Discussion**: The applicants from Hacker News tend to reflect the industry as a whole, and women only made up a small percentage of the group. While I think there could be some great candidates that applied (and I will review them all), the HN audience may not be the first place to go to source a diverse array of candidates.

Other considerations: I only posted the one job description targeting a specific type of engineer (full-stack). I chose to summarize what Craft does differently than shown in job descriptions.

## Results

Within the first 2 days (and primarily the first 24 hours):

* **11** emails from candidates, including 9 resumes (all men)
* **6** LinkedIn connection requests (4 candidates, 1 React consultant, 1 recruiter, or 4 men & 2 women)
* **2** LinkedIn InMail messages
* **34** people directly applied to the job (and after 3 days, this increased to 51 people)

A small number of people contacted Craft or me in multiple ways (such as emailing me their resume and applying directly to the job).

Of the 34 direct applicants:

* Men: 29
* Women: 5

![Of 34 direct applicants, roughly 14.7% were female and 85.3% were male.](/assets/uploads/2020-11-02-hacker-news-direct_applicants.svg)

![Of 34 direct applicants, 20 had 0-2 years experience, with the rest distributed mostly between 3-8 years experience.](/assets/uploads/2020-11-02-hacker-news-direct_applicants_vs-_years_experience.svg)

![Most applicants are based in the United States (27 of 34), which makes sense because HackerNews is based in the US.](/assets/uploads/2020-11-02-hacker-news-applicants_vs-_country.svg)
